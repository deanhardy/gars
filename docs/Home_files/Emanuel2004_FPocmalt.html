            <P>One morning in June of last year, my friend Bryan and I found 
            ourselves engaged in the somewhat hilarious task of examining the 
            right bank of the Flint River on the edge of town in Albany. A young 
            guy was fishing nearby (his t-shirt read "The good. The bad. The 
            grad. 2002."), and two little boys splashed in the shallows with 
            their mother. Fifty yards away, a cataract poured from the open 
            gates of the Lake Worth dam. Big wooden signs with block lettering 
            cautioned, "No Swimming" and "Danger: Water Subject to Rapid Rise 
            and Violent Turbulence." 
            <P>The two of us were attempting a riparian vegetation survey and a 
            bird point count, as we'd been doing every 10 river miles for the 
            past three weeks. A task that typically immersed us in riverbank 
            fauna and flora seemed silly as we stood on the barren concrete boat 
            ramp with the roar of the artificial waterfall in our ears. 
            <P>Before long, though, Rick and the two friends we'd conned into 
            going with us returned from a grocery run, and it was out again into 
            the verdant riverbank forests of southwest Georgia.

            <P>This was a part of a project we call the Georgia River Survey. We 
            were near the end of 26 days spent on the Flint, traveling by canoe 
            and doing a generalized ecological survey of the river corridor on 
            the way. The crew: a party of fairly recent Georgia grads with a 
            decent bit of fieldwork experience in the life sciences, and with 
            degrees ranging from biology and ecology to English, who thought we 
            might stick around town a little longer and do some self-educating 
            on the natural history of our home state. To this end, we came up 
            with the river project. 
            <P>The survey involved frequently gathering water-quality data: pH, 
            dissolved oxygen, specific conductivity, temperature and turbidity. 
            Plus, we stopped every five river miles for point counts, listening 
            for 10 minutes to all the birds we could hear and identify. We noted 
            all the birds heard from the boat on the way downstream as well. We 
            collected insects and a few fish for the Georgia Museum of Natural 
            History. Using a GPS, we stopped every 10 miles to record the plants 
            growing on the bank, in the floodplain, and 200 meters away from the 
            river. The idea was to try to get a snapshot of the river as it 
            stood in June of the third year of the twenty-first century, and as 
            it changed in its course to the sea.

            <P>We did similar trips last summer on the Satilla and on the 
            Etowah. In September, Dean (the fourth of our core membership) and I 
            did a hundred-mile pleasure cruise on the Ogeechee and towed the 
            water quality device we'd used on the other, more intensive trips. 
            In May and June of this year, the whole crew and a few friends spent 
            six weeks on the Ocmulgee and Altamaha rivers, traveling to the 
            coast on the largest river whose drainage is entirely within 
            Georgia. This 370-mile paddle occasioned a view of much of the 
            state, from the Piedmont south of Atlanta into the Coastal Plain at 
            Macon, around the Great Bend up to Lumber City, past the confluence 
            with the Oconee, and down to Darien on the Altamaha. 
            <P>In addition to the protocol described above, we pay a lot of 
            attention to the general appearance of the river, making continuous 
            notes about the size and behavior of the stream, the wildlife, and 
            both the vegetation and the land use on the banks. This last task 
            sometimes means listing all the houses whose decks jut out over the 
            water or whose manicured lawns extend just to the top of the 
            riverbank. Sometimes it means trying to quantify the steepness and 
            shape of the bank below a dam or adjacent to a clear-cut, where the 
            river, sadly, has become severely channelized. And sometimes it 
            means estimating the height and describing the splendor of a 
            magnificent cypress or a sycamore or an elm as we pass it by. 
            <P>We also do a good bit of talking to local residents - especially 
            fishermen - for they know things that we would never notice about 
            the river, plus a little history oftentimes, like where the baptisms 
            were held before they got running water in the churches in Ware 
            County. Down around Nahunta, Rick got a lecture on the ills of 
            alcohol and the virtues of God's Nature from a drunken carpenter at 
            the Satilla Club, a smoke-filled bar overlooking the river with 
            Creedence on the jukebox. Some guys working for the Jenkins County 
            road crew had a good time telling me about all the critters that 
            were gonna come and get me down in the swamp on the Ogeechee - 
            including the elusive hog-bear. And when you come around a bend and 
            an old man fishing from the bank proclaims that, "This here is a 
            river you could easily fall in love with," it's hard not to agree. 
            <P>The past two years' river trips have taken us to all kinds of 
            places, not just to boat landings like the one in Albany. Once, two 
            of us were in an impenetrable thicket of greenbrier and blackberry 
            brambles, swatting mosquitoes and wondering what in God's name we 
            were doing in that cow-hell swamp. We finished the Flint with our 
            GPS directing us straight to a survey point in someone's backyard in 
            Bainbridge. We paddled through Georgia towns like Albany, Waycross, 
            Macon, Cartersville and Rome. We also got to paddle some beautiful 
            stretches in the blackwater swamps on the Satilla, in the Blue Ridge 
            on the Etowah, and through Pine Mountain on the Flint. We explored 
            some glorious spots like Magnolia Bluff in Camden County, the woods 
            and slopes of the Dawson Forest and a handful of clear, cool springs 
            in the floodplains of the Flint and the Ocmulgee. The Altamaha and 
            the Satilla brought us to the edge of the salt marsh, where the 
            river changes dramatically and journey's end brings your canoe to a 
            dock where you tie up beside a shrimp boat.

            <P>A lot of our motivation involves really seeing the country where 
            we all grew up, and where we live. Most every town has a river 
            either in it or nearby, and every river flows downstream and 
            eventually out to sea. A couple of years ago, some of our members 
            did a trip down the Oconee and the Altamaha, from Milledgeville to 
            Darien, and the time had on that trip created much of the impetus 
            for this project. Part of the idea behind that original trip was 
            that it's really neat to put in a boat on the river in your town and 
            take it down to the coast. The reservoirs downstream of Athens made 
            that option incompatible with folks' schedules, so Milledgeville was 
            the put-in. But the idea was a good one. 
            <P>Later, the experience of that Oconee-Altamaha trip combined with 
            an interest in William Bartram (the Quaker botanist who tromped all 
            around here late in the 18th Century) formed the plan to observe the 
            land as naturalists while traveling by canoe. Bartram made a 
            historical record of our regional landscape that has become 
            incredibly valuable in the aftermath of the near-total alteration of 
            that landscape through farming and timbering. If we can make a 
            record of the river corridors in the state of Georgia in the years 
            2003 and 2004 and perhaps create a model for others to use in the 
            future so as to have a group of documents that offer comparison of 
            the land over time, then we will consider our project to have been 
            worthwhile.

            <P>One such record already exists from the 20th century. It's a book 
            published in the Ô70s by the DNR: The Natural Environments of 
            Georgia, by the late Charles Wharton. Anyone familiar with Dr. 
            Wharton's book can easily see why we have gained a good deal of 
            insight and inspiration from it. Folks who've looked through 
            Bartram's Travels might remember the account of one of his boat 
            trips on the Altamaha, in which he refers to the river's "pellucid 
            floods." "Pellucid" is a fancy word for "clear," and anyone who has 
            boated on the Altamaha recently knows that it is anything but clear, 
            as it now carries a great deal more sediment than it did in 
            Bartram's day. That contrast alone speaks volumes about the changes 
            this country called Georgia, and its rivers, have undergone in the 
            past couple hundred years. Bartram never encountered dams or 
            reservoirs either, and never stood on a paved boat landing looking 
            around for plants. But we figure maybe that's the point: whatever we 
            see is part of the ecology of the river today, so we'll record it. 
            <P>For now, thanks to all the folks in town, on campus and elsewhere 
            who've helped us out thus far. We're off the water now, and are 
            beginning the process of collating all the information we've 
            gathered. We'll be sure to let folks in Athens know when we've got 
            something to show for all the time we've spent on Georgia's rivers. 
            Until then, there are lots of photos on our web site:
