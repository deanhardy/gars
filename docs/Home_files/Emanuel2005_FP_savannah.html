On the last day of September, I catch my ride before dawn to get down
to Augusta, to a marina on the Savannah River, for a boat trip. Frank
Carl, the Executive Director of the Savannah Riverkeeper (SRK), has
assembled a group to travel the river from Augusta to Savannah: an
educational trip he calls the "Coastal Plain Meander."<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>The name, while cute, carries some irony. The "Meander" part
borrows the name given to the wide, oxbow-shaped bends that the river
(or any river) makes as it curves and winds its way downstream through
the soft, alluvial sediments of its Coastal Plain river valley. The
irony comes in when one considers that the river lost 42 miles of its
length to work done decades ago by the US Army Corps of Engineers to
straighten the river out, to cut new, more direct channels across those
sinuous meander curves so as to make the river trip shorter for barge
traffic.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>The double irony comes with the historical fact that as soon
as the Corps finished with that work, some time in the '60s, barge
traffic on the river was all but dead anyway. That's only one of many
contradictions to be found on a river whose forested banks and jumping
fish conceal an industrial past and, in places, a heavily industrial
present.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_subheader><b>We Launch
</b><body_subheader><br><br>

<body_reg>Our starting point in Augusta is a back-lot boat dock a
little below downtown. The river there is wide, flat and calm. Frank
refers to it as "the pond," because for 15 miles or so it's backed up
by the New Savannah Bluffs Lock and Dam, a water-control structure
built to make Augusta's port more manageable in the days when the
city's commerce depended on the river. That is, the river isn't a river
at all when you leave town on it. It's just a long, skinny pond in the
shape of a river. Upstream loom a few big reservoirs (Hartwell, Russell
and Strom Thurmond) plus a short stretch of free-running Fall Line
shoals just above Augusta, and a small lock-and-dam downstream.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>We motor pretty fast through the pond, though, in order to
keep on schedule and make our appointment with the lockmaster. Our
craft is a 45-foot pontoon boat, with a vinyl roof, several rows of
cushioned bench seating, and twin 115-horsepower outboard motors. When
he wants to, our captain can get the thing moving. Mike Snead, the
pontoon's captain and owner, had the boat custom-built for eco-tours in
the rivers and estuaries all around Savannah &#8212; "dolphin tours" and
such. Frank chartered the boat for this event, one he hopes will grow
from year to year (this is its third), a way to get interested citizens
and Riverkeeper members, as well as himself, out on the water, out on
the Savannah. Our crew on this trip includes Frank and his wife, Jan;
Captain Mike and his first mate, Walt; several outdoorsy, birdwatching
retirees from Augusta and Savannah; a science textbook-writer and avid
outdoorswoman also from Savannah, my friend April Ingle, who is the
Executive Director of the Georgia River Network (based in Athens); and
me.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>When we get to the lock, a boat catches our attention, coming
up from behind. It is a small Maine lobster boat &#8212; well, really a
nice-looking, custom-made pleasure boat in the style of a lobster yawl
&#8212; called the <i>Acadiana</i>. The <i>Acadiana </i>ties up to go
through the lock with us, so we have a chance to ask her crew what in
the world they are doing on the Savannah River. The man and woman on
board tell us they've brought her all the way along the Atlantic coast
through the Intracoastal Waterway, then up the Savannah to Augusta for
a spell. Saying, "Yeah, she's a one of a kind on this river," the man
tells me, "&#8230; I became a riverboat captain on the way up here." His yawl
isn't built at all right for the twisty-turny currents in the big bends
of a river like the Savannah. Captain Mike gives the fellow traveler
some advice on how to navigate them. Once the water drops (some three
or four yards in height!) and the lock gates open up, the <i>Acadiana </i>speeds
away downstream, her wake beating at the river's muddy banks. Mike
wonders aloud whether we'll see her again on our way downstream,
pointing out that the steering is easier going upstream, and that there
are an awful lot of submerged snags for a captain to watch out for. But
we never do see the <i>Acadiana</i> again after she rounds the bend below the lock, so she must have made out okay.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_subheader><b>Industry's Impact
</b><body_subheader><br><br>

The lock itself, of course, is a relic from the days of the barges, but
it still has its impact on the river. Once we're through it, Frank
smiles to tell us that there will be no more impoundments damming the
river's flow from here to the sea. On the other hand, it isn't long
before we pass by some of the heaviest industry on the Savannah. One
plant, a manufacturer of caustic sodas and chlorine, has a small canal
coming out to the river. Pointing at it, Frank grins and says, "They're
used to seeing the Savannah Riverkeeper boat go up that channel." He
has a 20-foot pontoon of his own that he uses for regular check-ups and
water samples on the river.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Pointing at an industrial outfall a little way downstream,
Frank tells us its plant has "about 600 pounds of mercury
unaccounted-for each year." The implication, of course, is that the
missing mercury is going to the river. Most freshwater is full of
mercury anyway: it comes out of the air, where it exists as a product
of coal-fired power plants, and is deposited into water bodies. Mercury
is the reason for the "fish consumption guidelines" put out by the
Department of Natural Resources &#8212; more than one meal a week of a
certain fish from a certain stretch of a certain stream is officially
more than people ought to eat. But mercury going straight into the
river from an industrial outfit? Yikes.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>I'm not sure, anyway, whether Frank is exaggerating the 600
pounds or not. Being on the river with Frank Carl is a little bit that
way: he is very knowledgeable about his river, and he's glad to share
his knowledge &#8212; after all, it's his job &#8212; but as his ever-present
subtle, sly smile suggests, there's no guarantee that in the right
company, the information will come without an opinion attached.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Of course, no one doubts that this is the right group for
tallying some of the abuses the Savannah suffers. Before long, everyone
gets the idea and starts pointing out pipes and culverts draining to
the river. Frank is curious about any he didn't already know about. ("A
pipe? What in the hell is that from?")<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>I begin to realize that this trip is a good opportunity for
Frank himself to get out on the river and take note of its condition.
He notes the mile mark of every unfamiliar pipe and culvert, as well as
every pasture whose cows have free access to the river. Although
farmers can pump river water out to water their herds, it's illegal for
cattle to be unrestricted from actually entering the river, where they
tend to enjoy standing around cooling off, chewing their cud, and
performing other bodily functions regardless of any thoughts of keeping
a downstream community's water source clean. We see several such spots
on our first day alone, all on the Georgia side of the river. Frank is
surprised; on last year's trip, he says, there weren't any cows in the
river on the Georgia side. He makes a note to check in with some of
those farmers after the trip.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_subheader><b>Nuclear Presence
</b><body_subheader><br><br>

<body_reg>

Of course, there isn't much but woods on the South Carolina bank. We
aren't far out of Augusta when we begin seeing menacing signs warning
against trespassing on the land to our left: the Savannah River Site.
In the 1950's the U.S. Department of Energy went looking for a big,
empty tract of land on which to start up a nuclear facility. They found
an area with vast undeveloped swampland, evicted a couple of small
towns wholesale from the adjoining pine woods, and created a
310-square-mile property that would become both a major part of the
nation's nuclear program and an ideal locale for ecological studies
(UGA's Savannah River Ecology Lab) in a largely undisturbed wilderness.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Today, there are several inactive nuclear reactors and a good
deal of nuclear waste still on the site. Unfortunately, research has
shown that some of the waste is not well-contained; the streams
draining the site are bringing high levels of tritium down to the
river. For this reason, Frank's boat is a frequent visitor to the
mouths of these creeks, too. Because of the high level of security on
the site, the mouths of its creeks are gated, but Frank has sampled the
water they discharge into the river.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>The government samples the water through there, too. It is a
strange sight, every so often in that isolated, wooded section of
river, to come upon a little miniature white boat, moored to a piling
and facing upstream, with a little solar panel on top to power the
automatic water-sampling equipment inside. These little robot-skiffs
occasionally come to life for a few seconds, some motor inside them
cutting on to push against the current briefly and keep the little
boat's bow pointed upstream.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Just around the bend from one of those automatic samplers, we
come upon the private landing where a generous stranger's river house
is our home for the night. Set back from the river, up on a low bluff
with a grassy mowed lawn is a modest, pleasant-looking house with the
customary large deck overlooking the river. Everyone, including Frank,
is impressed with the peacefulness of the surroundings. Frank has
talked to the owner, a man named Hargrove, on the phone, but he hasn't
seen the place.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Walking up the slope and around the front of the house we
come upon a carved wooden sign hanging over the front porch: "Cliff's
Folly." The front of the house, away from the river, looks out on a
large, grassy field beyond which the two huge cooling towers of Plant
Vogtle &#8212; a nuclear power plant on the Georgia side &#8212; loom over the
trees. Huge clouds of steam issue from the tops of the towers, the only
blemish (albeit a significant one) on the rustic scene.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Inside, it is evident that the Hargroves have had their share
of fun there at Cliff's Folly. Framed snapshot collages document a few
years' worth of a big annual cookout called the "Spring Thaw." Others
show smaller gatherings of drinking good old boys: one series is titled
"A Dysfunctional Weekend Adventure at Hancock Landing." On the living
room wall is a trophy mount, the snarling, massive head of a 350-pound
wild hog shot in the swamps of the Savannah around Thanksgiving some
years back. In the corner, a book of Tennyson's poems sits on the
table. A 19th Century map of Burke County hangs on the kitchen wall.
For a place so far back in the country, Hargrove's has its charm.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>I pitch my tent on the lawn beside the river and sleep well
there. A couple of times I wake in the night and think I see lightning,
but it is only the bright strobe lights ringing the tops of the cooling
towers at the power plant. In the morning, our benefactor, David
Hargrove, shows up to ready the house for the rest of the weekend, and
we have a chance to chat with him before we launch for the day. He
tells us a little bit about the recent history of the place. His father
bought the land in the '50s, and before long Georgia Power came through
condemning land to build Plant Vogtle. But the family was able to hold
out, and Hargrove says he doesn't mind having the cooling towers in
view, or the Savannah River Site just across the river. He hunts and
fishes there just the same, and he remembers when the industries
upstream, towards Augusta, treated the river like dirt.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>"When my father bought this place in 1956," he tells us,
"this river ran red and stunk to high heavens." Frank, ever the
teacher, then turns to the group and enjoins us: "Remember that, what
he just said. That's the Clean Water Act." Frank is pointing out a fact
underlying most all of the work being done under the auspices of the
Riverkeeper movement. In the last three decades, the Clean Water Act
has made improvements by leaps and bounds in cutting back on
large-scale, unregulated industrial discharges into surface waters in
this country, resulting in dramatic and salient changes for the better
on a lot of rivers. But there's still a lot of work to be done: the
growth of an urban area like Augusta, for instance, increases drinking
water withdrawal, wastewater input, and polluted stormwater runoff. All
that industry we'd seen the day before, although it's cleaner now, is
still there.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Not to mention all the nuclear material at SRS. Hargrove
spends enough time hunting and fishing on the river to know a little
bit about what goes on there. He tells us that every now and then, a
spent nuclear reactor comes upriver by barge for storage at SRS. At
such times, the Corps of Engineers lets a lot of extra water out of the
dams upstream so the river will run high, making passage easier, and
the barge with its special payload slips quietly upriver from the coast.<body_reg><br><br>

Our crew gains some new members on the second day: SRK board member
James Marlow and his two sons, Tyler and Zack, drive down from Atlanta
to join us. Tyler's a sophomore at the newest high school in Gwinnett
County, and his brother's in middle school there. They are talkative,
outgoing kids who'll fit in well in Athens in a few years: they both
see the folly of the current development trends in their home county. I
am quickly impressed with their grasp on Gwinnett's dire situation and
their willingness to talk about it. While I am chatting with Tyler
about all the land he's seen cleared recently, Zack walks up hyper and
excited about a plan he's just hatched, having heard me say I live in
Athens. "We need to find out where they're gonna cut the trees down,"
he says, "and set up a stage at the entrance, and get R.E.M. to play,
so they won't be able to go in and cut the trees."<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>"Why R.E.M.?" I ask.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Zack shrugs. "Because they're hippies."<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Tyler sighs and looks away at the river going by, then groans lackadaisically: "I'm gonna chain myself to a bulldozer."<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>That day on the river, we go through many of the 66
artificial cuts that the Corps of Engineers made, removing so many
looping meander curves and oxbows from the river's course. Frank and
Mike talk about the Corps' efforts to resuscitate the dying barge
traffic decades ago. Because of competition from railroads and
trucking, barge commerce died anyway. Mike said, "They spent billions
and billions of dollars, and as soon as they finished, there was no
traffic."<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>But the effects of the Corps' work are still there. Anywhere
they altered the river's course, there is "riprap" on the river's banks
&#8212; chunky granite rocks placed there to prevent the bank from eroding
away. If it not for the riprap, it would be hard to tell that the river
has been so drastically altered. (After all, over time the river itself
cuts off those looping oxbows anyway, physics and gravity always
pushing the water to seek a shorter course to the sea.) But even down
there in the swamp, in the middle of nowhere, there are the signs of
what people have done to change the river. In addition to the riprap,
we frequently come upon old groupings of wooden pilings in the water,
erected long ago to catch snags and sediment and keep them out of the
navigational channel.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>That day and the next, traveling the river is a study in
contrasts. We are on an isolated stream buffered on both sides by wide
swamps. We see egrets, herons, ibis, osprey, even a young bald eagle.
We pass by bluffs with magnolia, beech, redbay, and bluff white oak
towering over the river. Overcup oak, cypress, willow, ash and all the
other swamp hardwoods are plentiful elsewhere. We see dozens of
alligators and one raccoon, scare away countless turtles and hear owls
at night. But the industry upstream is fresh in our minds, and the
legacy of the river's commercial past is nearly everywhere to see, if
you look for it.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_subheader><b>Can't Rest
</b><body_subheader><br><br>

<body_reg>On the trip's fourth and final day, we make our way into
Savannah. Most of the day, the Savannah National Wildlife Refuge is on
one or both banks, so we are presented with more undisturbed, serene,
wooded floodplain. In the morning, we see several wood storks, auspices
of a good last leg to the trip. Several miles upstream of the city, the
river splits up into the different channels of its delta. Though we
take the Front River into town, we first explore the top end of the
Middle River, in scrub marshes that used to be rice fields. Here and
there, narrow canals lead off through the marsh &#8212; canals dug 200 years
ago to drain the marsh for rice crops. We even see the remains of an
old sluice gate, used to control the height of the water in the fields.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>Before long, on the right bank of the Front River, we come
upon more of the present-day industry: a Weyerhauser paper mill,
another power plant (this one coal-fired), a sugar refinery, and then
the remarkable Port of Savannah. A collection of huge new cranes is
helping to load and unload the cargo of the massive freighters in the
port. On our left, the wildlife refuge eventually has given way to a
long island with high banks and scant vegetation: the dumping ground
for the dredge spoils from the harbor. Mike describes for us the huge
controversy brewing these days over proposals to dredge the harbor a
few feet deeper so as to keep up with the shipping industry and
accommodate even bigger ships in the port.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>It is then that I start to realize the immensity of the tasks
before Frank's fledgling Riverkeeper organization. The range of issues
to address throughout the watershed is daunting. From the port, we
quickly reach River Street and disembark in the bustle of a Monday
afternoon in downtown Savannah, the last bluff on the river. Here our
crew splits up, and those who are headed back upstate pile into a van
whose route roughly parallels our downriver voyage in reverse. Riding
back through the pine woods and cotton and soybean fields beyond the
river's floodplain on the South Carolina side, I have a chance to talk
with Frank some more about the SRK's future. He tells me his goal is to
give the organization a solid foundation for growth. At some point
he'll hire a development staffer and then, later, someone who can be
out on the river full-time, more than he's able to be right now. We
talk about the various challenges facing the river itself: from the
urbanized watershed in Augusta to way up in Clayton, Georgia, where
Stekoa Creek has been filled with sediment by the mountain-valley
sprawl along US 441, hundreds of miles away from the harbor that may
soon be deepened. Then there are the chemical and thermal pollution
from the various factories and power plants, plus the contamination at
SRS.<body_reg><br><br>

<body_reg>The van takes the lone two-lane highway through SRS on the
way back, and Frank points out with pride the names of the various
creeks we cross there, the same ones whose mouths we'd seen at the
river. It's hard for him to learn much about even the geography at SRS;
security is such that you're not allowed out of your car on that
highway, not even to pick up trash, much less to sample those streams.
It was encouraging to see Frank doing his damnedest to learn what he
can about those creeks anyway. More than that, I admire him for taking
on the bigger task before him. He's got a whole river to keep.<body_reg><br>
